# Week 4 Assignment
Introduction/Business Problem

A community association has noted that there has been an increase in foot traffic in their neighbourhood and they are concerned about the potential for increased crime. They are looking to learn about what types and amounts of crimes have been committed and reported in the past to set a benchmark to monitor whether or not there is an increase in crime in their neighbourhood and if so, what kinds. The audience is primarily those on the community association, but there is a potential for the information to be formatted into an ongoing report in the newsletter so a summary of the data should be prepared to show a snapshot for community awareness.

Data 

Information on crime statistics will be parsed from public records and placed into a table. I will remove the data that I don't need by removing the columns that aren't relevant. I will ise FourSquare data location to overlay the crime numbers on a map of the neighbourhood. using different colors for the different kinds of crimes.

This process can be set to repeat as needed to produce an ongoing dashboard report for the neighbourhood association as well as for the stakeholders.

Sample data will be pulled from: https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects-start/crime_and_justice
